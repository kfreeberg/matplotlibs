Observations

Of the four drugs in this analysis, Capomulin seemed to have the best out come in all four analyses.  The tumor response to treatment with Capomulin seems to be far superior to that of the other two drugs and the placebo.  In the trial Capomulin is the only one to show an overall decline in the volume of the tumor, going from 45 mm3 to about 36 mm3, a decline of about 19%.  It also seems to slow the metastasis of the cancer slightly better than the Infubinol, as well as have a better survival rate than the rest.  Interestingly the group treated with the placebo had a smaller increase in volume than the group treated with Ketapril.
